# Proton-hydroxide-availability-coefficient
This Python jupyter Notebook code accompanies my recent paper titled Understanding pH within a nanoscopic water pool (10.26434/chemrxiv-2022-bjdlh).
It post processes the raw data (.txt) from a type of kinetic Monte Carlo simulation that generats proton and hydroxide ion pairs from water, and extract the ion pair availability coefficient (as defined in the paper) to gain insights into water pool too small to have a consistant pH. 

For example, 500 mil.txt contains the simulation results of 500 million water molecules. Step 1 records the water ion pair recombination reaction and Step2 records the water ion pair generation at the corresponding time stamp.
