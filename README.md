# Proton-hydroxide-availability-coefficient
This Python jupyter Notebook code accompanies my recent paper titled Understanding pH within a nanoscopic water pool (10.26434/chemrxiv-2022-bjdlh).
It post processes the raw data from a type of kinetic Monte Carlo simulation that generats proton and hydroxide ion pairs from water, and extract the ion pair availability coefficient (as defined in the paper) to gain insights into water pool too small to have a consistant pH.
